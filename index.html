            <h2>About s/f/w√∏nderland</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              <b><i>s/f/w√∏nderland</i></b> was first conceptualised as a senior capstone project for my B.A. in Design Media Arts at the University of California, Los Angeles. My main intention for this project was to create queer art that is research-driven and collaborative, yet no less personally resonant. I knew from the start that this was going to be about queer existence(s) in my home context, namely Malaysia and Singapore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Malaysia and Singapore both share similar histories as former British colonies, and are both ruled by conservative-leaning governments in their respective contexts. Due to media censorship policies, state erasure of queer history, criminalisation of acts of sodomy, and little to no protections of LGBTQ+ rights (among many other factors of queer stigma), looking for support systems, credible queer knowledge, and positive queer representation in these regions is, to say the least, <em>really fucking</em> hard. In the field of academia, most research on local queer communities here focus on healthcare and policy-related topics (and arguably necessarily so) - although such studies are already limited in number to begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the general gap in literature and documentation regarding queer communities in these places where I grew up, I wanted to reflect on my role as a queer media artist that grew up in this environment, and explore queer existence and community creation in the age of social media. In particular, I was interested in how queer people learned about, and then later navigated queerness while existing in a mediated media landscape + social infrastructure that denies LGBTQ+ people any positive representation and legal protections.‚ú®
            </p>
            <div class="box callout">
              <p>
                <b>‚ú® For more information on Malaysia and Singapore‚Äôs policies regarding the LGBTQ+ community</b>, refer to the Penal Code Section 377 as a head start. I‚Äôd also recommend reading about censorship laws regarding ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign interference‚Äù in these countries, too. As queerness is often erroneously framed as a Western import in these countries, many have reason to fear that these media laws might be misused to restrict their freedom of (queer) expression.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>
              During my spring break, I invited 6 friends to discuss their observations and experiences navigating social media as people who:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                identified somewhere under the queer umbrella; AND
              </li>
              <li>
                had experiences growing up in Malaysia and/or Singapore.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              All of us happened to be born in the 90s or early 2000s, and began using the internet in our late-primary ~ early-secondary school days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through our conversations, we learned that most of us had our first encounter of queerness through fan fiction and queer fandom pairings on the Internet - many shared experiences reading slash on fanfic.net, in particular. This media platform provided an alternative source of knowledge and guidance beyond parental figures, state-controlled media, and educational institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As such, for my capstone project, I wanted to focus on the (re)imagination of queerness through media appropriations of censored content as a form of creative resistance against oppressive state-enforced infrastructures. While every participant has their own understanding of the role queer fandoms play in the broader political environmentüí°, most believe that the transgressive nature of queer fan-made narratives and worlds are not merely avenues for escapism, but are also capable of shifting attitudes and perceptions concerning queerness on a broader societal level.
            </p>
            <div class="box callout">
              <p>
                üí° Some participants shared that they saw queer fandoms as a way to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù or ‚Äúhack‚Äù inaccurate / negative / violent depictions of queer people in mainstream media, while others are more inclined to view fandoms as an alternative outlet for ‚Äúreimagination‚Äù which provides its own form of agency.

            <p>
              Zoyander Street‚Äôs <a href="https://zoy.itch.io/iportraits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Interactive Portraits: Trans People in Japan</i></a> was a huge inspiration not only for this project, but also for my media art practice in general. It helped me realise that game-making and ethnographic research do not have to be mutually exclusive practices; that research can culminate into something other than a densely-worded dissertation paper; that games can be a new way of understanding and engaging with the knowledge we create. It‚Äôs the game that really got me excited about the practice of game-making and conducting research as an artist, so huge kudos to Zoyander and their work! Zoyander also wrote an insightful chapter about community histories and challenging normative research practices in Bo Ruberg and Adrienne Shaw‚Äôs book titled <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt1mtz7kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Queer Game Studies</i></a>, which was helpful in informing my approach to <i>s/f/w√∏nderland</i>.

            <p>
              Hua is a gender-glitched experimental interactive media artist and animator who is interested in researching the intersections between queerness, transnational experiences, post/neo-colonialism, and digital bodies+communities on the Interwebs. They like to explore games as a medium for communicating the complex nuances of socially-constructed identities like gender, sexuality, language, and nationality, as well as how they interface with broader interpersonal relationships and socio-political infrastructures. Ever since they relocated to U.S.A for their tertiary education, Hua has been navigating the implications of discussing themes of liberation and recovery from colonial trauma in their home context while existing on foreign, occupied land.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hua‚Äôs independent animations and video games have been showcased at events like Cartoons Underground (Singapore), Melbourne Queer Games Festival (Australia), and Animation Chico (USA).

            <p>
              Although <i>s/f/w√∏nderland</i> is primarily rooted in the context of Malaysia and Singapore, this project was created while I was residing on the traditional land of the Chumash and Tongva people. As a beneficiary of the resources and support granted by the University of California, Los Angeles, I recognise my complicity in the historical and ongoing legacy of land theft initiated by colonial settlers since the 18th century. As an international student, my access to queer safety and freedom of expression has not been without my participation in settler colonialism. Moving forward, I want to continue confronting what it means to live on stolen land, and further contemplate ways in which we can support disenfranchised and Native communities. For starters, I recommend reading <a href="https://unsettlingamerica.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/decolonization-is-not-a-metaphor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang‚Äôs ‚ÄúDecolonization is not a Metaphor‚Äù</a>, an article which foregrounds how settler colonialism operates and what ‚Äúdecolonisation‚Äù really entails.

              <p>This painting tool works best on a <strong>fullscreen desktop browser with audio turned on</strong>! Unfortunately, the painting tool isn't compatible for mobile phone users at this time.</p>
              <p><strong>If you have photosensitive epilepsy</strong>, please proceed with caution - there will be flashing colours and images on the left half of the window. A possible workaround is to adjust the size of your browser window to half its original width <em>after</em> opening the painting tool, then scroll to the right so that only the right half of the tool is visible.</p>
