          <p>s/f/wønderland is a web-based painting tool that explores fandom cultures as a transgressive and creative space for queer liberation, particularly in the context of state-enforced media censorship in Malaysia and Singapore.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            given the gap in literature and documentation regarding queer communities* in places i grew up (Malaysia and Singapore), i wanted this project to explore queer existence from the perspective of social media and digital community creation. in particular, i was interested in how queer people learned about and later navigate queerness in a local media landscape + social infrastructure that denies lgbtq+ people of any positive representation nor legal protections**.
          </p>


          <!--
          *most research on local queer communities in Malaysia and Singapore focus on healthcare and policy-related topics (and arguably necessarily so.)

          **for more information on Malaysia and Singapore’s policies regarding the lgbtq+ community, refer to the Penal Code Section 377 as a head start. i’d also recommend reading about censorship laws regarding “fake news” and “foreign interference” in these countries, too, which many reasonably fear would be misused to restrict freedom of expression (even re: queer representation.)
          -->

          <p>
            during the spring break, i spoke with 6 friends who: (1) identified somewhere under the queer umbrella, AND (2) had experiences growing up in Malaysia and/or Singapore.
          </p>
          <p>
            all of us happened to be born in the 90s or early 2000s, and began using the internet in our late-primary ~ early-secondary school days.
          </p>
          <p>
            through our conversations, we learned that most of us first came into contact with the notion of queerness through fan fiction and queer fandom pairings on the internet - many shared experiences reading slash on fanfic.net, in particular - which provided an alternative source of knowledge and guidance beyond parental figures and local media + educational institutions. as such, for my capstone project, i wanted to explore the (re)imagination of queerness* through media appropriations of censored content as a form of creative resistance against oppressive state-enforced infrastructures. while every participant has their own understanding of the role queer fandoms play in the broader political environment**, most believe that the transgressive nature of queer fan-made narratives and worlds are not merely avenues for escapism, but are also capable of shifting attitudes and perceptions concerning queerness on a broader societal level.
          </p>

          <!--
            *inspired by my partner Cheng Shon’s bachelor’s thesis titled “Love, Queerly Reimagined: Negotiating Normativity in Boys’ Love (BL) Fandom Cultures.”

            **some see queer fandoms as a way to “correct” or “hack” inaccurate / negative / violent depictions of queer people in mainstream media, while others are more inclined to view fandoms as an alternative outlet for “reimagination” which provides its own form of agency
          -->
          <p>
            other research references / interests included Chaoyang Trap’s article on Chinese fanfic writers navigating post-AO3 ban era and cartographic charts marking queer presence + history in Queering The Map and Pink Dot SG’s “Love Lives Here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            while this project is primarily made with my participating friends in mind, it is also available for other people who are familiar with / grew up with / dare i say, thrived through queer fandoms, particularly when they are unable to enjoy such queer freedoms openly in their own environment due to fear of prosecution, social stigma etc.
